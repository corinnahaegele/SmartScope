Smartphone-attachable for low cost brightfield and fluorescence microscopic imaging

This Smartphone Microscope was constructed as a group project at the Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena (University of Applied Sciences). The purpose of this project was to construct a low-cost and high-resolution smartphone-attachable that is able to perform brightfield and fluorescence imaging. 
Since current benchtop microsopes usually are expensive, quite bulky and require a skilled operator, schools and developing countries often lack the access to high-resoltion imaging devices, whereas most people posess a smartphone and know, how to use the camera-apllication. Furthermore, smartphones automatically save the images in a digital file and by its nature weigh little and able to transfer data wirelessly.
