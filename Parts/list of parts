Smartphones:

current smartphone adapters have been implemented for geometries of following devices:
- Huawei Nova
- Huawei P30 Pro



Lenses:
Setups were constructed and printed for following lenses:
- 9mm diameter and 9mm focallength: https://www.edmundoptics.eu/p/90mm-dia-x-90mm-fl-uncoated-plano-convex-lens/5572/
- 5mm diameter and 5mm focallength: https://www.edmundoptics.eu/p/50mm-dia-x-50mm-fl-uncoated-plano-convex-lens/5709/


colour filter:
flourescence imaging was impleneted using following filters:
- 12.5mm diameter and cut-off wavelength of 580nm: https://www.edmundoptics.de/p/o-58-580nm-125mm-dia-longpass-filter/20574/
- 25mm diameter and cut-off wavelength of 590nm: https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FGL590M


LED:
excitation of fluorescent sample was archieved by using following LED:
- typical wavelenght 525nm: https://www.leds-and-more.de/catalog/smd-5050-plcc6-led-ultrahell-gruen-2500mcd-120-chip-p-1379.html?osCsid=tl46casp77ge3mi5qtluc61te4#!tab2

Sample:
As fluorescent sample, red polyethylene microspheres were used. The beads can be excited by a broad spectrum of light and emitts red light with wavelength= 607nm
