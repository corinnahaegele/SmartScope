# Brightfield imaging

For brightfield imaging, insert the glass slide into the slit intended for the slide. 
The sample should be on the surface facing away from the camera. 

When using the 9mm-setup, the thread between barrel and sampleholder can be used to adjust the slide to the optimal focal lenght. 
The 5mm-setup does not feature this extra thread since barrel and sampleholder are combined in one part. 

For optimal imaging results, hold your microscope setup against an ambient light source (like a window or a lamp). This will increase contrast and images will be sharper.

Following images were obtained with the Huawei Nova:

# Fluorescence imaging

For fluorescence imaging, insert the glass slide into the slit intended for the slide. 
The sample should be on the surface facing away from the camera. 

When using the 9mm-setup, the thread between barrel and sampleholder can be used to adjust the slide to the optimal focal lenght. 
The 5mm-setup does not feature this extra thread since barrel and sampleholder are combined in one part. 

Please use a dimmed environment for the imaging progress, as less ambient light reduces the amount of scattered light and images will be sharper.

Hold your LED-circuit onto one side of the slide, so that the LED is centered on the surface as shown in the following pictures and schematics. LED-light will be guided by Total Internal Reflection.

The sizes of the microspheres ranged from 32µm to 38µm, which was important for determining the resolution of fluorescence imaging.

## Resolution of fluorescence imaging

The microspheres had fixed sizes from 32µm to 38µm and therefore were used as object micrometer. Since the particular size of the observed one microsphere was unknown, resolutions for both the best case scenario (32µm sphere) and worst case scenario (38µm sphere) were calculated and are shown in the tables below.
The method used for the calculation was the method of "doubled lenght of pixels".
