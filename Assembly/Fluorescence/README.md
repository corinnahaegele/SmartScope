# Instructions for assembly of fluorescence microscope

Choose the parts as listed in the folders 5mm or 9mm.

Assemble the parts like shown in the pictures below:

## 9mm Setup
Insert the 9mm-lens in the barrell with with the flat surface facing outwards. The surface of the lens should be flush with the barrell.

Insert the mobile phone into the basis-slot (display facing down) and mount the other parts (with lens inside of barrell). 
The color filter can be taped onto the barrel's inner surface so that it's center is above the lens.

Lastly, insert the slide with the sample into the slot of the sampleholder.
The thread connecting sampleholder and barrell can be used to meet the exact focal lenght of the lens.


## 5mm Setup

Select whichever color filter you would like tu use and the corresponding sampleholder (Barrell and sampleholder are combined in ONE part) and basis-geometrie as listed. Insert the filter:
- 12.5mm Filter
